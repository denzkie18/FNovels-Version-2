      <span>Hello to you reader!. I am DenZ, the one who created this fun made website. As I also like to read light novels and had been done reading a lot of them and happened to stored a couple of them, I don't want to waste them so I made this website to share my light novels to you.<br/><br/>As I working alone up to this point and create this website only using my android phone because I cannot afford to buy a PC or Laptop, the uploading and updating is a bit slower. I thankful for your understanding and patience for waiting. I am a poor youngster and currently studying as 1st year collage, I took all my savings to buy a domain for this website that cost me 8$ dollars that only last until 12 months.<br/><br/>When you download a light novel, you will be jump to another website that contains advertisement and I truly sorry for that. As I my self wanted to this website do not have an annoying ads but I'm afraid I cannot, because with the help of this ads, I gain a little bit of income that I plan to keep for recharging to the domain but unfortunately, even a year cannot earned at least 5 dollars. So I was hoping if I could gain a little bit of your support by donating any amount through GCash or Paypal.<br/><br/>If you want to donate, please send a message or contact me on my official Facebook Page. Thank you for all of you and hopefully you enjoy using my little fun made website. Thank you...
